I wanted to push my limits with a project, so I built Thulloâ€”a Trello clone. It was a great challenge to see if I could handle creating a complex app with lots of features.

Features:

- View and manage boards
- Create new boards with cover photos, titles, and visibility settings
- Add lists and cards, and move cards around with drag and drop
- Update board info, add members, and handle admin tasks like removing members
- Edit card details, add comments and attachments, and customize labels and cover images from Unsplash

It was a fun way to dive into the nitty-gritty of building an app with many features. If you want to check out the details and design I followed, take a look at the user stories here: [DevChallenges](https://legacy.devchallenges.io/challenges/wP0LbGgEeKhpFHUpPpDh).
