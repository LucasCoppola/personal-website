<!-- Most people i know who work out, use Google Sheets or Excel to track their workouts (if they track them at all). -->
<!-- I was no exception, using 2 different apps to track my progress and some other stuff. So, i thought, why not bring everything together in one place but for my own needs? -->
<!---->
<!-- Well, i did. I created Lift to track my training, i can create blocks or meso-cycles (like 4-week plans), build my own routines, and personalize blocks by changing exercises, sets, reps, etc. -->

<!-- To track progress, there's section where you can see how you did with weight and volume over time for a particular exercise. You can also check out your personal bests or records for any lift. -->

Lift is an app created to track your training. You can create blocks or meso-cycles (like 4-week plans), build your own routines, and personalize blocks by changing exercises, sets, reps, etc.

There's also a section to track progress over time, showing how you did with weight and volume for a particular exercise. It even shows personal bests or records for any lift.
