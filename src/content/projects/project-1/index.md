Lift is an app created to track your training. You can create blocks or meso-cycles (like 4-week plans), build your own routines, and personalize blocks by changing exercises, sets, reps, etc.

There's also a section to track progress over time, showing how you did with weight and volume for a particular exercise. It even shows personal bests or records for any lift.
